# werther_effect
This is the repository for the code used to generate the results in my working paper "Reanalyzing the Werther Effect: The Impact of Highly-Publicized Celebrity Suicide on Suicides."

## Steps for replication

There are four steps to a successful replication:

1. Download entire ````werther_effect```` repository.
2. Change the path in line 15 of ````werther_effect/analysis/run.do```` to the location where you put the ````werther_effect```` folder. You can skip this if you put the ````werther_effect```` folder in ````C:```` (i.e., ````C:/werther_effect````).
3. Extract ````us.1969_2017.19ages.adjusted.txt```` from ````us.1969_2017.19ages.adjusted.exe```` located in ````C:/werther_effect/analysis/data```` (keep both files in that folder).
4. Do ````werther_effect/analysis/run.do````.
